The concept based on the ideas of Dominion from Pico52 . I extended the building mechanics with the functions of HeroStronghold.

The HeroStronghold plugin has an excellent building and configuration mechanic. The base idea is to get the regions and superregions into a administration tool, the settlements.  Some special regions and superregion configuration are necessary for work with the settlements. The production and supply balance based on the region upkeep and output recipes. The creation cost based on region requirements.

The settlements do automatic production based on the installed buildings and the recipe describe in the regions of //HeroStronghold// . 

The settlement should interact and make some trade based on differences in their production and requirements of supply. 

The biome give the differences for production efficiency and make trade necessary. In the settlement is a trade manager installed who managing this task.
